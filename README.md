# Weather Forecast App

In this module, I created a weather forecast application. This application obtains a weather forecast of the country where the user is with the device's GPS or the user can inform the city, in addition to choosing which thermometric scales  they want to view.

I could learn:

 - How to create a dark-mode enabled app.
 - How to use vector images as image assets.
 - Learn to use the UITextField to get user input.
 - Learn about the delegate pattern.
 - Swift protocols and extensions.
 - Swift guard keyword.
 - Swift computed properties.
 - Swift closures and completion handlers.
 - Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
 - Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
 - Learn to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
 - Learn to use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
